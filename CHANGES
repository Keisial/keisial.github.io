3.0.3 UNRELEASED
 * Add options for 'resulttype' to DnsResult.req to allow for binary or text
   data to be returned
 * Returned AAAA to it's pre-3.0.2 default of binary result (text results can
   still be gotten via resulttype='text')
 * Switch DNS.getTXTdata back to returning a string.  This is consistent with
   what dnspython3 does as well.  The switch to bytes was a bad idea.

 * Fix DNS.getTXTdata to return bytes instead of a Unicode string
 * Add more granular exception sub classes of DNSError, see SF #3388075

   - Thanks to Shane Kerr for the patch

3.0.0 Wed Feb  9 23:35:22 EST 2011

Ported to Python3 by Scott Kitterman <scott@kitterman.com>.  This is mostly a
minimal port to work with Python3 (tested with python3.2) plus addition of
some of the patches that people have submitted on Sourceforge.  It should be
fully API compatible with 2.3.
